How do you plan to make your game engaging?
 
To make my game engaging I would like to add some milestones as well as 
Some good sound effects that suits the game. At last I would like to make the characters look more wonderful and also  the villain of the game should be very powerful so that every players who should be  playing  the game will find it quite challenging .
